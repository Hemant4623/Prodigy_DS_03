Overview

This project involves building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. As part of my data science internship at Prodigy Infotech, I used the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to train and evaluate the model.

Features

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and ensured data consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Summary statistics of the dataset.
Visualizations to understand relationships between variables.

Model Building:
Implemented a decision tree classifier.
Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.
Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tools and Libraries
Python: The programming language used for analysis and modeling.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating the decision tree classifier.

Conclusion
This project allowed me to apply my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning. Building the decision tree classifier provided valuable insights into customer behavior and the factors influencing their purchasing decisions. I look forward to applying these techniques to more complex datasets and models in the future.
